**Today's Progress**: I have been working on familiarize myself with JavaScript fundamental again, such as data types, comparison and logical operator, and functions 

**Thoughts: I actually less excited at the beginning since I learnt most of them before. But I have told myself that I may able to gain a deeper understanding about the fundamental knowledge and practice, and keep learning about it. After an hour, I have proven that I was right. Dev Ed is really a great developer / teacher in this topic, and I really enjoy the joke and the explanation process.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

** target/goal: complete the dev ed course, complete at least 3 projects with HTML, CSS and JS, and implement the JS in the portfolio.

### Day 1/100: Feb 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I have been working on familiarize myself with JavaScript fundamental again, such as data types, comparison and logical operator, and functions 

**Thoughts: I actually less excited at the beginning since I learnt most of them before. But I have told myself that I may able to gain a deeper understanding about the fundamental knowledge and practice, and keep learning about it. After an hour, I have proven that I was right. Dev Ed is really a great developer / teacher in this topic, and I really enjoy the joke and the explanation process.

### Day 2/100: Feb 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continue to work on the JS fundamental: object and array, also switch :)

**Thoughts: I feel more confident to write the data structure. By learning the basics of data structures, I can now simplify and organise my code, without writing them repeatedly.

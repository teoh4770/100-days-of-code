# 100 Days Of Code - Log

\*\* target/goal: complete the dev ed course, complete at least 3 projects with HTML, CSS and JS, and implement the JS in the portfolio.

### Day 1/100: Feb 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I have been working on familiarize myself with JavaScript fundamental again, such as data types, comparison and logical operator, and functions

\*\*Thoughts: I actually less excited at the beginning since I learnt most of them before. But I have told myself that I may able to gain a deeper understanding about the fundamental knowledge and practice, and keep learning about it. After an hour, I have proven that I was right. Dev Ed is really a great developer / teacher in this topic, and I really enjoy the joke and the explanation process.

### Day 2/100: Feb 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continue to work on the JS fundamental: object and array, also switch :)

\*\*Thoughts: I feel more confident to write the data structure. By learning the basics of data structures, I can now simplify and organise my code, without writing them repeatedly.

### Day 3/100: Feb 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finish all the Javascript Fundamental, including different for loop, and while loop, and complete a small Guessing Game project.

\*\*Thoughts: From planning to executing, and eventually testing, it tooks longer time than I thought it would be. Even though the Guessing Game was a small project, I still felt proud of myself to be able to pull it out.

### Day 4/100: Feb 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learn 2 things today, one is that simplicity is key in programming and thinking process. I love how Dev Ed's codes are just simple and straight to the point, which makes his code looks clean(even though it is just a guessing game). The second I have learnt today is Document Object Model(DOM) selectors and the difference between the nodelist and HTMLCollection.

\*\*Thoughts: A bit exhausting, cause I didn't break the learning plan well, and give it a go, which hugely affect my productivity today. 1 hour work becomes 3 hour works...but anyway, a lesson learnt is a lesson earned. Also, I'm excited to learn about DOM again, and apply it to my portfolio.

### Day 5/100: Feb 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I have started to learn about DOM selector, eventListener, and overall difference between nodeList and HTMLCollection

\*\*Thoughts: Today is like an offday for me. Learning while watching zombie movie cause me lose focus on the task at hand. An hour work -> 2 hours work...But it is still quite nice cause I have learnt quite a lot already.

## Day 6/100: Feb 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I have finished the DOMMMMM session, and learn about event bubbling, local and session storage.
Event bubbling is the event that trigger multiple reaction, creating the bubble effect, because they have added 2 or more event listener in the same div.
Example, when we added a click event to the list inside the 'div', then we added another click event to the 'div'(parent) itself, and trigger the div event, it will affect the list event too.

\*\*Thoughts: My eyes shut already, after completing the EC140 homework and the coding session. Honestly, I feel quite excited after finished the DOM, and really wanna implement this in my portfolio.

## Day 7/100: Feb 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Start to implementing the DOM concept into making a todo list, have already finished half way.

\*\*Thoughts: Quite satisfy with my efort today. I quite surprise that I could understand and execute the steps the instructor did. #programmingisfun

## Day 8/100: Feb 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learn how to create delete, check, and filter functionality in my to do list :>

\*\*Thoughts: Although there are some bugs appear that frustrated me a bit, but I really enjoy the solving process. Besides, I finally have the ability to implement dom, and some kind of functionalities into my portfolio, and future project.

## Day 9/100: Feb 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learn about keeping the data with localStorage, learning how to parse and stringify JSON objects, and track the real time data when the things on todo list is being added or deleted.

\*\*Thoughts: This todo project is simple enough to help me implement all the fundamental of javascript, and I sure have a lot of fun with Dev teaching style. Can't wait to do more exciting projects and go deep...

## Day 10/100: Feb 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finally finish the 1st project - Expanding Cards in Brad Traversy 50 projects in 50 days course, and just realise that I have reach 10% of my target goal to reach 100 days coding challenge.

\*\*Thoughts: This expanding cards project enables to enhance my understanding of DOM even more. Now, I am finally able to add DOM to the elements, without any
guidance.

The looks of expanding cards

Whenever you click on other object, the expanded object will shrink, while the object that user just clicked will expand.

Able to use it in the description section in my portfolio!!!

## Day 11/100: Feb 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Making my portfolio responsive on both the desktop and phone. Adding expanding row bar to my portfolio for interaction. Also to practice my javascript thinking skill.

\*\*Thoughts: another day for coding ~

## Day 12/100: Feb 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I continue the Dev Ed course today after completing a project and adding changes to my portfolio. I am currently in chapter 4 - Arrays, and has learnt about the difference between primitives and reference data types, callbacks, higher order functions and "difference between forEach and map function".

\*\*Thoughts: I am really enjoying coding right now. And now I realise that if I keep going do the project without continue the course, I will lose way much time, finding the resources about array and object methods by myself, which now I think about it, is a very good decision. :> Lez's goooo
